# Agile Workload Tracker

## Preface

The agile management approach helps us to guide software development projects toward the most valuable outcome possible with the goal to accommodate the unpredictability of the project that adversely affects the expected results and workload assessment. It is, therefore, proposed to be applied also to high-risk innovative research projects based on a fixed-price contract. A methodology based on Scrum and supporting tools derived from a generic business process model is proposed with the aim of harmonizing and embedding agile principles as contract rules. The case study result proves that convergence between management rules based on an agile approach and business objectives leads to a real improvement in key performance indicators and customer satisfaction index. The proposed methodology is recognized as a practical approach to making the project an adaptive process.

## Repository

This repository contains the Agile Workload Tracker ( AWT) program that supports agile management and workload tracking to improve the performance of project team planning, developing, and launching new products. The AWT application simplifies planning and reporting while using Scrum principles by managing your backlog, planning sprints, and optimizing process flow.

The implemented reports show the details of the current workload of resolved tasks, the workload for a specific sprint (milestone), and projects - showing the unresolved issues and remaining workload.

AWT can also be used by teams to capture and organize current operational issues of any organization, work through action items, and stay up-to-date with team activity.
